            This framework is inspired by CodeIgniter and many other. You'll find
            all the nice stuff I read about. I'am no pro and maybe there exist
            hundreds of thousand ways to do things better, more secure, faster,
            etc... I hope so, I love to read and learn stuff about PHP.
